402	Alex	Panipat	Maths
403	Stuart	Jammu	Maths
404	Adam	Noida	Physics


First Normal Form:

Student	Age	Subject

Stuart	17	Maths


Second Normal Form :

New Student Table following 2NF will be :
Student	Age
Adam	15
Alex	14
Stuart	17
In Student Table the candidate key will be Student column, because all other column i.e Age is dependent on it.
New Subject Table introduced for 2NF will be :
Student	Subject
Adam	Biology
Adam	Maths
Alex	Maths
Stuart	Maths

Third Normal form applies that every non-prime attribute of table must be dependent on primary key, or we can say that, there should not be the case that a non-prime attribute is determined by another non-prime attribute. So this transitive functional dependency should be removed from the table and also the table must be in Second Normal form.
Student Detail Table:

Student_id	Student_name	DOB	Street	city	State	Zip

New Student_Detail Table :
Student_id	Student_name	DOB	Zip
Address Table :
Zip	Street	city	state
